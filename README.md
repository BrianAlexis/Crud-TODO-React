# 📝 TaskMaster - CRUD TODO App

Welcome to my task management application! This project is a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application built with **React** and **TypeScript**, focused on a clean architecture and an interactive user experience through sound feedback.

## 🚀 Features

- **Full Task Management**: Easily create, mark as completed, and delete tasks.
- **Auditory Feedback**: Typing sounds while writing and success sounds when adding tasks.
- **Clean Architecture**: Logic separated into **Custom Hooks** (`useTodos`, `useSound`) and UI divided into reusable components.
- **Dynamic Counter**: Real-time visualization of pending tasks.
- **Persistence**: Your tasks are automatically saved in **localStorage**.
- **Modern Design**: Stylized interface built with **Tailwind CSS**, featuring animated gradients, grainy textures, and smooth entry animations.
